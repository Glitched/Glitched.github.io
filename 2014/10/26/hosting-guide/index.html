  <!-- <time datetime="2014-10-26T00:00:00-04:00" class="page-date">26 Oct 2014</time> -->
  <p>Hosting is incredibly diverse, but smaller websites only have a few options. The cheapest kind of hosting with the least upkeep is shared hosting. This usually is the poorest preforming type of host, but what many inevitable start out with.</p>

<p>The second option is a Virtual Private Server (VPS). These usually cost more money and require technical skills to manage and maintain over time, but have the advantage of complete control and better performance.</p>

<p>The final option is a platform as a service provider such as Heroku. PAAS resides somewhere between shared hosting and a VPS, in that it has the performance of a VPS but has limitations in exchange for a completely managed environment.</p>

<h2 id="shared-hosting">Shared Hosting</h2>

<p>Hosts in this category generally advertise unlimited everything, but have hidden limitations. Shared plans are great because they are cost effective, and have everything you need for a basic site in one package. Some even offer a free domain along with your hosting, but at the expense of a tie-in. If you have yet to purchase a domain, I would recommend reading <a href="/2014/10/25/domain-guide/">my post on domains</a>. Many also offer free email accounts, Cloudflare integration, and one click app installation.</p>

<p>The problems with shared hosting include a slower loading website and less control than alternatives. According to a Kissmetrics study, slow websites have been linked to significantly decreased conversions and sales. However, not all shared hosting has horrible load times. <a href="http://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=0ea914461a856773e600c7e7aeaa6dab">Siteground</a> has all of the features you can expect from a shared host and some of the best performance you will find. WPSiteCare recently preformed a <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/performance-of-7-top-wordpress-hosting-companies-compared/">test</a> of many different shared hosts and decided that Siteground was the best value.</p>

<p>Shared hosting is best for small sites that just display content. I would recommend using a different platform if you plan to do anything serious such as ecommerce.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-private-servers">Virtual Private Servers</h2>
<p>A VPS gives you control over your entire site, from the operating system it runs on to the web stack. That being said, great power comes with great responsibility. You need to understand what you are doing to run a VPS well and protect it from security flaws. Properly configured, a VPS will run much better than a shared host because you are given your own resources, just for your site. A VPS is the ideal environment for running a site that has multiple languages like Node.JS, which are not often found in a shared host.</p>

<p>Linode and Digital Ocean are both excellent VPS hosts that are nearly identical. There are slight differences, but they are insignificant. Digital Ocean offers a cheaper base plan than Linode for $5/month, while Linode starts at a $10/month plan. You really can’t go wrong with either, so it is up to your personal preference.</p>

<h2 id="other-options">Other Options</h2>

<p>Platform-As-A-Service providers (PAAS) are unique players here. They attempt to bring the performance of a VPS with some of the automation of a shared hosting account. This site is hosted on Heroku, and I have had a great experience with them. The hosting is lightning quick and has great uptime. It isn’t quite as fast as a VPS, but it has all the features I need and I love the add-on ecosystem, which allows you to easily add 3rd party features to your site.</p>

<p>If you plan on using Wordpress, there are some great services dedicated specifically to Wordpress. I really like <a href="http://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=0ea914461a856773e600c7e7aeaa6dab">Siteground’s</a> GoGeek plan, which includes a staging area that allows you to test code modifications before rolling them out on the live site. Copyblogger Media also has a great option with Web Synthesis.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-phase">The Next Phase</h2>
<p>From here, it is time to create the site itself. I highly recommend starting with a simple coming soon page and submitting your site to search engines as soon as possible. Search engines place value on site age, as it indicates trust. Submitting a coming soon page can help your site rank higher once it launches officially.</p>

<p>I will be posting more information in the coming weeks on the development of a website, so stay tuned!</p>

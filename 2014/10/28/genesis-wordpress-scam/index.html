  <h2 id="how-genesis-misleads-customers">How Genesis Misleads Customers</h2>
<p>Copyblogger Media/Studiopress had a brilliant idea. Make a simple, minimal theme and market it as having advanced features in SEO, Security, and HTML 5. What they neglect to mention is that they are using misinformation to sell their themes. Genesis retails for $60, more than the most expensive themes on ThemeForest. Copyblogger then tries to sell a child theme on top of that, to further increase profits.</p>

<h2 id="the-false-promise-of-seo">The False Promise of SEO</h2>

<p>The number one feature they tout is Search Engine Optimization. What they fail to mention is that a theme is not a magic bullet and cannot “optimize” your website for Google. A lightweight and well coded page does have the potential to increase rankings, but Genesis has nothing that other well-coded themes do not have. On top of all this, Genesis is not even coded that well. GTmetrics has a side-by-side <a href="http://gtmetrix.com/compare/fHPzcvMr/msQlOLD7">comparison</a> between Genesis and Schema by MyThemeShop. Unsurprisingly, Genesis was destroyed. </p>

<p>Genesis does have built in Schema.org markup, which Google has explicitly denied using as a ranking factor. That’s not to say Schema does not have its place; it does. Schema can still be used to get <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/99170?hl=en">rich snippets</a> in search results.</p>

<p>Finally, Copyblogger mentions Google authorship as part of their SEO feature list. Unfortunately for them, authorship has been discontinued for months and is now just dead weight on the HTML page. So much for lifetime updates. Many companies could benefit from Google Publisher markup, but Genesis does not have that feature.</p>

<p>Rather than looking for a theme with SEO as a feature, just add a free SEO plugin like Yoast that will do more than a theme ever could dream of doing.</p>

<h2 id="the-false-sense-of-security">The False Sense of Security</h2>

<p>A poorly coded theme can introduce a security vulnerability, but a theme advertising security as a feature is no more secure than any other high-quality theme. Copyblogger attempts to make their theme seem more secure than the competition and uses fear-mongering to drive sales:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WordPress sites can be vulnerable to those who want to take your site down or exploit it for malicious reasons. Having your site hacked is an expensive, time-consuming hassle — and it can really damage your reputation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-false-reviews">The False Reviews</h2>

<p>A quick search for “Genesis framework reviews” brings back only positive results. I wish I could say this was because their product was a joy to use. Unfortunately the reviews are because of an entirely different reason. Copyblogger/Studiopress has a giant affiliate program, which pays site owners who sell their themes. Anyone who publishes a positive review makes 35% of all the sales that their post generates though tracking cookies.</p>

<p>You will notice all of those reviews either send you to an affiliate link or go to a page that redirects to an affiliate link. For each person that buys Genesis from a review, the reviewer makes $21. For each person that buys Genesis and a child theme, they make $35. </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Genesis by Studiopress is a scam that effectively pays off reviewers. It is not as lightweight as its competition and does not offer any benefits over a “standard” theme.</p>
